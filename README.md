# Mogami

---

Mogami is a RISC-V CPU (RV64GC) with out-of-order execution. This project is designed for low-cost chip and currently targets Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (because I ran out of money). 

Now the project only has in-order ALU and FPU completed. The ALU and FPU in this version are only for testing and will not be used in the out-of-order version, where it will be broken down and controlled by uops.

This project is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
